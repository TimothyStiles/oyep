Roadmap
Open Yeast Engineering Project

Making it easier for everyone to engineer yeast.

We get together at BosLab and try to engineer yeast to do cool things then share what we've done with the internet.

    Join us at BosLab or at your own community lab. Read through our roadmap and issues we're facing. Pick one and tackle it!

Short term - what we're working on now üéâ

    Homology arms 
        Designing primers to help integrate GFP DNA into the yeast genome without antibiotic resistance casettes.
        
    Finding a better way to document work
        Benchling and github aren't really cutting it. A large portion of our team are molecular biologists without much programming experience.
        
    CRISPR and media troubleshooting
        Our first CRISPR knockout experiment didn't work! Was it the plasmid or the new media we used? How can we test this?
    
    Finding good gene construct design tools that anyone can use
        This may actually end up being a whole new project in itself if we have to make it ourselves...
        
Medium term - what we're working on next! üç∞

    Brewing beer
        What good is engineered yeast if you can't drink it? GFP beer and vitamin A ros√© are a couple of ideas that have popped up.
        
    Migrating to new design and documentation system
        Benchling isn't cutting it. A lot of our lab notes are physically written down. Designing constructs with open software may not be possible.
        
    Learn how to assemble linear and circular DNA
        Get a google protocol together on how to assemble DNA fragments into working constructs.
        
    Pull off our first multi-knock-in yeast strain.
        A lot of interesting things that you can produce with engineered yeast require multiple genes to be added/modified/knocked-out.
        
   
Longer term items - mostly speculative but we'll see what happens! ‚è©

    Developing a markdown language for protocols.
        It would be cool to have a markown language for protocols that included timers, interactive plasmid maps, videos, photos, etc with a tiny IDE and viewer.
    
    Developing gene editing software
        I'd like to see an open source IDE for bioengineering. Maybe this is a pipe dream but who knows.
    
    Dextinctifying flavors and fragrances from plants that have gone extinct
        Mining sequences for scent producing enyzmatic pathways that we can put into yeast.
        
    Making insulin
        An interesting target for healthcare and diabetes activism.
